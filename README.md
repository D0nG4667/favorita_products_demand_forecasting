# favorita_products_demand_forcasting
As a data scientist at Corporation Favorita, I'm tasked with ensuring that we always maintain the right quantity of products in stock. To achieve this, I've chosen to develop a series of machine learning models to forecast the demand for products across different locations. I adhered to the CRISP-DM Framework for Data Science projects.
